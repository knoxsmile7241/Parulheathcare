The  Internet - of - Things  (IoT)  has taken over the business  spectrum   and  its   application s vary   widely from agriculture, 
and  healthcare,  to  transportation etc.   A h ospital environment can be very stressful ,   especially for senior citizens and 
children.  With  the  ever - increasing   world  popula tion,  the  conventional  patient - d octor  appointment   has  lost  its 
effectiveness.   Hence  smart  healthcare  becomes   very  important .  Smart  healthcare  can  be  implemented  at  all  levels, 
starting from temperature monitoring for babies to monitoring vital signs in  the  elderly. The complexity and cost of 
implementation varies base d on the  required   precision of the individual devices, functionalities and sophistication of 
the  application  for  which  they  are  used.  Smart  h ealt hcare  also  falls  under  vertical  areas   such  as  VLSI,  embedded 
systems, big data, machine learning, cloud computi ng and Artificial Intelligence.  This article discusses the importance, 
requirements and applications of smart healthcare along with the current industry trend s   and products. It gives a deeper 
insight about the different platforms across which more research   can be pursued in this dynamic domain.  
 
1.   INTRODUCTION  
Traditional healthcare is unable to accommodate everyone’s need s   due  to  the  tremendous  increase  in  population. 
Despite   having  excellent  infrastructure ,  and  cutting - edge  technologies,  m edical  services  are  not  approachable   or 
affordable  to  everyone .  One of the goals of s mart healthcare  is to  help  users by  educating  them  about the ir   medical 
status and keeping them health - aware.  Smart healthcare   empowers users to self - manage some emergency situations  
[1 ] .  It prov ides an emphasis on improving the quality and experience of the user. Smart healthcare helps  in utilizing  
available   resources   to  their   maximum potential. It aids remote monitoring of patients  and   helps in reducing the cost 
of  the  treatment  for  the  u ser .   It  also   helps  medical  practitioners  to  extend  their  service s   without  any  geographical 
barrier s .   With  an   increasing trend towards smart cities, a n   effective   smart  he althcare system assures a healthy living 
for  its citizens .  
Connected health in general refers to any digital healthcare solution that can operate remotely and is a collective term 
fo r subsets such as telemedicine and  mobile - health , but with an additional component of continuous monitoring of 
health,  emergency detection   and alerting suitable individuals automatically .  Connected health mainly focuses on the 
mission to improve the quality and efficiency   of healthcare by  enabling  self - care  and complementing it with  remote -
FIGURE   1.  Classification  of Smart Health C are .  
care . It has its origin  i n   the era of telemedicine ,   where the user s   are   educated about their health and  are given  feedback 
whenever required.  While smart healthcare refers to solutions which can operate completely autonomously, connected 
healthcare offers solutions for the users t o  receive   feedback from clinicians.  The most important classification, which 
redefines the ec onomy of the smart healthcare ,  is  the end user market. Depending upon whether the healthcare network 
is to be implemented for individuals or hospitals, the cost, p ower, and architecture varies widely.   
Figure  1   shows  the  broad  classification   of  the  s mart  healthcare  market,  based  on  the  services,  medical  devices, 
technologies used, applications, system management and end users. Connectivity technologies used play a vital role 
1  
 

in  expanding  the  application s   for  which  the  healthcare  system  is  designed.   Efficient  integration  of  s mall  devices 
through wireless technologies can help in implementing remote health monitoring through  the  Internet of Things  (IoT) 
[ 2 ].    If a personalized monitoring device such   as a wrist band is used, a Bluetooth module, 6LowPAN or RFID can be 
used to con nect the device to the internet. But in a hospital scenario where a healthcare network is maintained, Wi - Fi 
and ground cables are required to maintain  constant   internet   connectivity and support heavy data traffic. The medical 
devices used to implement the  smart healthcare can be classified into on - body sensors and stationary medical devices.  
On - body sensors are  usually bio - sensors which are  attached to the human body for physiological monitoring. These 
sensors can be further classified into in - vitro and in - vivo sensors . I n - vitro sensors are attached  externally to the human 
body which helps in reducing the involvement of lab or hospit al facilities in healthcare. In - vivo sensors are implantable 
devices which are placed inside the body after fulfilling the regulations and standards on sterilization.   
2.   SMART  HEALTHCARE   ARCHITECTURES:  REQU IREMENTS,  COMPONENTS   AND 
CHARACTERISTICS  
Requirements  of smart healthcare  can be 
broadly  classified  into  functional 
requirements  and  non - functional 
requirements ,   as   shown   in   Figure   2 . 
Functional requirements  address   specific 
requirements    of    a  smart   healt hcare 
architecture.  For  example,   if  a 
temperature     monitoring     system     is 
deployed,  based  on  the  ap plication  it  is 
used   for ,  the  range  of  operation  of  the 
thermistor/thermometer,  data  collection 
mechanism,  and  fr equency  of  operation 
might  vary.   Hence  functional 
requirements    are    specific    to  each 
FIGURE   2 . Requirements in Smart   Health C are .   component used in that healthcare   system 
based on their application .  
On the other hand, non - functional requirements are not   very specific.  Nonfunctional requirements refer to attributes 
based  on  which  the  quality  of  the  healthcare  system  can  be  determined.  On  a  broader  perspective,  non - functional  
requirements  of  smart  healthcare   can  be 
classified  into  performance  requirements 
and ethical requ irements. Due to the  large 
number of verticals   involved in designing a 
complete  smart  healthcare   system, 
p erformance  requirements  can  be  further 
classified   into   software   and   hardware 
requirements.   Essential  requirements  for 
an  efficient  smart  healthca re  system  are 
low   power,   small   form   factor,  system 
reliability, quality of service,  enriched user 
experience,  higher  efficiency,  ability  to 
interoperate   across   different   platforms, 
ease of deployment, popularity of the smart 
healthcare   system   to   offer   continu ous 
support,   scalability   of   the   system   to 
upgrade  to  newer  versions  and 
FIGURE  3 .  Different Technologies used to D eploy Smart Healthcare .   technologies,  and  ample connectivity since 
the very prime motive of designing a smart 
healthcare   is  to  ensure  medical  service 
promptly. In advance d   applications, along with these requi rements, the system also need s   to have a mbient intelligence  
to improve the quality of service.

Perspectives  o f  smart  heath  care  widely  vary   amongst  researchers  and  industries ,   based  on  the  chosen  goal  to  be 
achieved.  Components  of  smart  healthcare  system  can  be  classified  based  on  the  sensors  or  actuators,  computing 
devices, data storage elements and networking  components. A sensor is an analytical device which combines with a 
biological element that creates a recognit ion of events [ 3 ].   Sensors or actuators vary based on the monitoring systems. 
Temperature senso rs, ECG, blood pressure, blood glucose ,   EMG, heart rate,  SpO , gyroscope,  motion sensors,  and  2
accelerometers , are the common sensors used in smart healthcare. Co mputing devices used in the present era range 
from  smart  phones,  tablets,  and  PDAs  to  complex  and  advance d   devices  such  as  su per  computers  and  servers. 
Memories play a very important role in smart healthcare since storing the information is the most import ant function 
of these systems.  D ata storage components in  the  smart heath care network cover a broader spectrum starting from 
embedded  memory  on  the  sensing  devices  to  big  servers  that  are  used  to  handle  big  data  analytics.  Networking 
components vary from link sensors to routers and base stations. Based on the severity of the problem addressed, the 
sophistication  of  the  components  varies.  Wireless  tech nologies  are  the  backbone  of  the  smart  healthcare  network . 
Different wireless technologies such as Wi - Fi, Bluetooth, 6LoWPAN, RFID   etc. , as shown in Figure 3 , play a vital 
role  in  exchanging  the  information  among  different  physical  elements  that  are  config ured  to  form  the  healthcare 
network.  
The  most  important  characteristics  required  for  smart  healthcare  system  are  shown  in  Figure  4.   Characteristics  of 
smart healthcar e can be broadly classified based on   three categories:  App - oriented, Things - oriented and S emantics -
oriented.   App - oriented  architectures need  t o  ensure  reliable  transmission  between  the  applications  in smart  phones 
and the sensors, establish a personalized network between the sensors and the user’s computing device and   secure the 
information. Things - oriented architecture s need   to be adaptive based on the application,  real time monitoring, on - time 
delivery,  higher  sensitivity ,  maintain  higher  efficiency  at  lower  power  dissipation,  and  embark  on  i ntelligent 
processing. Se mantic - oriented systems need to be able to develop behavioral patterns based   on the previously acquired 
information, process natural language processing techniques to enrich user experience and have ubiquitous computing 
capabilities   [ 4 ],  [ 5 ] .  
Adding to this list, other significant characteristics include  heterogeneous computing, spontaneous interaction across 
all the elements in the network, location - aware computing, dynamic network s   which can accommodate  a large   number 
of devices as required,  and  resource constrained co mputing with higher efficiency.  
3.   SMART HEALTHCARE NET WORKS:  CONFIGURATION, ORGAN IZATION AND FRAMEWOR K  
Wireless sensor networks  (WSNs)  were the initial research effort for  the  IoT.   Using WSN s   in different applications 
led  to   efficient  architectures  for  healthcare  applications   [ 6 ] .   There  are  many  dimensions  to  the  architectures  and 
platforms  used  to  deploy  smart  healthcare.  Research  in  healthcare  networks,  can  be  categorized  into  thr ee  major 
research  dimensions:  Configuration, 
Organization   and   F ramework.   Healthcare 
configuration   refers   to  the   assembly   of 
different   physical   elements   in   appropriate 
applications which can be used to address key 
issues . By placing the right sensors/ actuat ors  
in  environments,  heterogeneous  computing 
grid s    can    be    configured    to    use    such  
configurations  in  seamless  healthcare 
computing  environments  [ 7 ] .  On  the  other 
hand,   the  organization  groups  the 
specifications   of   the   healthcare   physical 
elements  along  with  the  hierarchy  of  the 
design. Smart healthcare architecture s   need to 
be interoperable across different technologies. 
FIGURE  4 . Characteristics of Smart Healthcare .   For  example,  the  sensors  used  in  the   body 
would   communicate   amongst   each   other 
through a personal area network or body area network. This in formation would be transferred to  a   smart phone through 
a Bluetooth or Wi - Fi technology and further will be processed across the network through  IPV6 [ 8 ] .  Thus,   organization 
helps in discussing the working principles and techniques involved in the   network  architectures. Research on exploring 
3  
 

big data techniques in healthcare services, using cloud assistive architectures and integrating multiple technologies to 
assure quality of service has been constantly gaining more atten tion from researchers worldwide  [ 9 ] , [10] .   
A  framework  for  smart  healthcare  architecture  includes   the  libraries  and  environments  in  which  the  healthcare 
architecture is used.  H ealthcare platforms can be widely classified 
into   network   platforms,   computing   platforms   and   service 
platforms.  Network  platforms  refer  to  the  networking  libraries 
used to interconnect different architectures. Computing platforms 
can vary widely based on t he technologies used. Due to diversity 
in the application environments of smart healthcare networks, the 
frameworks  for  computing platforms  are  usually  an  intersection 
of  wider  concepts  such  as  database  management,  optimization, 
human - machine interface, ma chine learning algorithms and so on 
[ 11 ]. Service platform refers to the support layer which acts as a 
middleware between the technologies and the users. This support 
layer  can  either  be  agents  or  call  center  representatives  or ,   in 
advanced  applications,  r obots  or  algorithms  with  cognitive  and 
behavioral   perspective.   A   framework   for   processing   health 
information  using  the  IoT  has  been  proposed  in  [ 12 ].   Figure  5 
shows  the  various  attributes  which  are  to  be  considered  before 
modeling   the   frameworks,   organizat ions   and  
platforms, specifically for smart healthcare.   FIGURE   5 . Attributes of Smart Healthcare .  
 
4.   SMART HEALTHCARE: SE RVICES   & APPLICATIONS  
From   the  healthcare perspective,  services  can  vary  from  push - notifications  on  the healthcare  mobile  App  to  cross -
connectivity  protocols  required  for  connected  devices ,  as  shown   in  Figure  6 .  Modifications  in  already  existing 
healthcare systems might he lp in int egrating these systems in smart healthcare. In addition to being secure and fast, 
these services should also be easily accessible to the patient.  Context - aware services  use   the current location of the 
user  to  provide  additional  services.  This  could  be   used   in  mobile  or  wearable  sensors.  For  example,   based  on  the 
information  received  from  the  sensor,  the  walking  trail  can  be  tracked  to  analyze  the  number  of  miles  covered.  I n 
some cases where the user ne eds additional help to call an a mbulance or a paramedic,   the required assistance can be 
provided  based  on  the  geographical  data  obtained  from  the  user.  Embedded  context  prediction  (ECP)  provides  a 
framework with appropriate mechanisms whi ch can be used to build context aware system. Context aware systems 
can op erate in ubiquitous environment s   [ 13 ].  
Semantic processing is a   behavior of  the  human brain to understand color s , pattern s , object s   etc. based on the context 
that  helps  in  deeper 
processing.    For  example,  
when   a   familiar   word   is 
heard,  the   brain processes  its 
meaning  based  on  semantic 
memory     which  involves 
common  knowledge.  In 
smart  healthcare,  the  use  of 
semantics and ontologies has 
led    to    a    service    called 
semantic     medical     access 
(SMA).        This    help s    in 
processing   ubiquitous   data 
available    in  the  medical 
cloud  and  providing 
emergency  services  by  FIGURE  6 . Services Available Through Smart H ealthcare .  
integrating   the se   services   [ 14], 
[15 ] .

Wireless Body Area N etwor ks (WBANs) are the basic components of c ommunity healthcare monitoring. Community 
healthcare   monitoring  helps  in  creating  a  network  around  the  local  community.  Multiple  WBAN   constitute  a 
community  healthcare  network  and  multiple  community  healthcare  networks   constitute   a  cooperative  network.  A 
c ommunity healthcare network might include schools,  residential area s , hospitals etc. which helps in provi ding energy 
efficient monitoring in rural area.   
Figure  7  demonstrates  the  a pplications  of  smart  healthcare ,  which   start  from  fitness  monitoring  on  one  end  of  the 
spectrum to vital sign monitoring in hospitals.  Based on the application, the quality of  health care systems  is   improved  
with additional machine learning algorithms  and artificial intelligence . The wide rang e of applications can be grouped 
into inter - body sensing, intra - body sensing and environmental management   [ 16] ,  [17 ] . Intra body sensing applications 
refer to those which  help   in monitoring multiple  vital signs. For  example,   in fitness tracking throug h a  smart watch, 
along with parameters such as number of calories burned, steps taken, active hours etc., it is also important to track 
the ph   s ensitivity of the sweat, oxygen intake of the body, heart rate monitoring ,   etc. In order to meet the competitive 
sma rt healthcare market,  companies   are trying to incorporate as many sensors as possible to offer ubiquitous sensing.  
Heart rate monitoring and remote ECG monitoring through wearables, have offered cost effective solutions in smart 
healthcare   [ 18 ].   In smart w atch es , it is also necessary to keep a track of the previous monitoring analysis. Algorithms 
that  incorporate  cognitive  and  behavioral  process es   are  being  deployed  in  these  sensors  to   discover   pattern s .   Such 
patterns  from  various  users  can  help  researchers   and  industries  to  develop  models  that  can  be  used  in  treating  a 
condition better. Examples for 
this  group  of  applications  can 
be    again  found   in   fitness 
monitoring  through  smart 
watches  where ,   with 
emergence  of  virtual  re ality, 
these  applications  are   used  to 
set  a  walking  or  hiking  trail . 
Along  with  providing  features 
such     as   localization     and 
tracking,   they  help   in  tracking 
the fitness of the user.   Creating 
sensitive and responsive digital 
enviro nments   has   made  the 
smart healthcare domain a multi   and 
inter - disciplinary  research   area  [ 19 ] .  FIGURE   7 . Application D omains in Smart Healthcare .  
Mobile  a pplications  that  are 
associated with  wearables   learn from the users, reason   about their intensions of using the device and help them plan 
in  achieving  their  fitness  goals  [ 20 ].  Environmental  management  applications  help  in  establishing  communication 
between the hospital and the patient. Monitoring the first responder’s health status in an endemic or epidemic outbreak, 
getting  ambulance  assistance  in  case  of  emergency,  developing  evacuation  schemes  for  disaster  manage ment  in 
hospitals, maintain ing   active databases to ensure correct delivery of organs/blood to the user s   in need, accurate billing 
of surgical procedure s   through RFID tags are some of the significant applications in environmental management.   
5.   THE  IoT  IN  SMART HEALTHCARE  
The IoT   is a combination of ubiquitous communication, connectivity and computing along with ambient intelligence. 
It refers to a cyber physical paradigm, where all the  real - world   components can stay connected.  The  IoT gives users 
the abili ty to  plan   every day and it integrates  real physical world elements such as  electronic devices, smart phones 
and tablets which can communicate both physically and wirelessly.  The  IoT helps in managing  virtually  any number 
of devices.  It   aims in extending t he benefits of internet such as remote access, data sharing and connectivity to various 
other  application  domains  such  as  healthcare,  transportation,  parking  act.</p>
